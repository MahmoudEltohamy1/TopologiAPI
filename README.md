# In a Nutshell
  This API parses a Json String containing a topology and a list of components, store them in the memory as a Topology Model class to do operations on them
  
# TopologyAPI
This API does the following:
  - Read and write topologies to and from disk.
  - Stores multiple topologies in memory.
  - Execute operationss on topologies.

# Topology
  A topology is a set of electric components that are connected together

# Programming Language
  Used java as it is a high level programming language that can read and write files efficiently. It has libraries for parsing JSON files and storing it's data as java classes(Model).
  also, java is the best practice for applying object oriented concepts

# Documentation
  Used javadocs for documentation of API
  
 # Testing
  Implemented test cases in an automated manner on the API level using junit library
